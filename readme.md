##  Overview

The ASCII-gen project is an open-source software designed to convert image sequences into ASCII art animated GIFs. It relies on required packages specified in `requirements.txt`, including multimedia handling tools and threading libraries. The Linux installer script sets up necessary dependencies for seamless execution. With a user-friendly graphical interface, ASCII-gen extracts frames from input sources, processes them using multi-threading, converts images to text format, merges frames into optimized GIF outputs, and offers options for display or saving.

##  Features

|    | Feature          | Description                                                |
|----|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| ‚öôÔ∏è  | Architecture     | Python-based project with clear separation of GUI and image processing logic.                       |
| üî© | Code Quality      | Well-structured codebase with readable functions and good documentation.                         |
| üìÑ | Documentation    | The repository contains detailed comments and instructions.                               |
| üîå | Integrations     | Depends on multiple packages like requests, PySimpleGUI, Pillow, and moviepy for multimedia handling.|
| üß© | Modularity       | Functions and scripts are logically separated into different files.                         |
| üß™ | Testing         | No apparent testing framework is mentioned in the project.             |
| ‚ö°Ô∏è  | Performance      | Processes images in parallel using multithreading to increase efficiency.                   |
| üõ°Ô∏è | Security        | Uses Python's standard security features and does not seem to handle sensitive data.          |
| üì¶ | Dependencies     | Lists several Python packages and libraries in `requirements.txt` for installation.           |
| üöÄ | Scalability      | No information provided about its scalability or handling large files or traffic.         |

Convert PNG to ASCII using ascii-image-converter.5. Merge frames into a single GIF file.6. Optimize the final GIF output.7. Display or save the generated GIF.8. Optional: clean up extracted files.Continue generating frames in parallel using multithreading. Convert each PNG frame to ASCII format, merge frames into a GIF file with infinite loop, optimize, and save it as output.gif. Optionally, display or launch the generated GIF in a viewer, then delete extracted files. |
